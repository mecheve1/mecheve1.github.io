            <p>I, Mateo Echeverry agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024, ITIS 3135 Web App Design and Development, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class itâ€™s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmatesâ€™ code directly.</p>
            <p>I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
            <p>Signed: <i>Mateo Echeverry, 4/29/2024</i></p>
